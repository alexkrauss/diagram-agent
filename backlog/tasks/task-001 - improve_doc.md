We want to improve general documentation so that we find ourselves around better

1. Work out the list of components that make up our system. This list should be discussed with the user.
2. Create a tree that shows where each component is found
3. For each component, create a spec that explains what it does in some detail.
4. Create a dependency diagram between the components.
