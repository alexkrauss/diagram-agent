Development tasks:

- [x] Persist API Keys in local storage, so that it does not have to be entered again each time. Plain text is fine, but make sure that this is provider-specific so we can use different providers later.
- [ ] UI: Present proper chat interface which displays the conversation, not just individual messages. Ensure proper keyboard navigability.

- [ ] Create a case where the LLM gets it wrong.
- [ ] Feedback loop: Rendered output back into the model.
- [ ] Evaluation framework: How to check if the model works properly?
